Assignment 3 contains an order form which is styled and provides a submit button for each order form, breakfast, lunch, dinner
Javascript is used to console the provided form with the users order. First validating the name and phone number of a user.
Javascript is then used as a for loop to iterate over each menu item, selection, and quantity.
I had a hard time with the javascript and consoling said information.
